                                <p class="list-group-item-text">An aircraft is a device that is used, or intended to be used, for
flight, according to the current Title 14 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (14 CFR) Part 1, Definitions and Abbreviations.
Categories of aircraft for certification of airmen include
airplane, rotorcraft, glider, lighter-than-air, powered-lift,
powered parachute, and weight-shift control. 14 CFR part 1
also defines airplane as an engine-driven, fixed-wing aircraft
that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of air against
its wings. Another term, not yet codified in 14 CFR part 1,
is advanced avionics aircraft, which refers to an aircraft that
contains a global positioning system (GPS) navigation system
with a moving map display, in conjunction with another
system, such as an autopilot. This chapter provides a brief
introduction to the structure of aircraft and uses an airplane
for most illustrations. Light Sport Aircraft (LSA), such as
weight-shift control, balloon, glider, powered parachute,
and gyroplane have their own handbooks to include detailed
information regarding aerodynamics and control.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">This chapter examines the fundamental physical laws
governing the forces acting on an aircraft in flight, and
what effect these natural laws and forces have on the
performance characteristics of aircraft. To control an aircraft,
be it an airplane, helicopter, glider, or balloon, the pilot
must understand the principles involved and learn to use or
counteract these natural forces.</p>

                                <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Aerodynamics of Flight</h4>
                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Thrust, drag, lift, and weight are forces that act upon all
aircraft in flight. Understanding how these forces work and
knowing how to control them with the use of power and
flight controls are essential to flight. This chapter discusses
the aerodynamics of flight—how design, weight, load factors,
and gravity affect an aircraft during flight maneuvers.
The four forces acting on an aircraft in straight-and-level,
unaccelerated flight are thrust, drag, lift, and weight.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">This chapter focuses on the flight control systems a pilot uses
to control the forces of flight, and the aircraft’s direction and
attitude. It should be noted that flight control systems and
characteristics can vary greatly depending on the type of
aircraft flown. The most basic flight control system designs
are mechanical and date back to early aircraft. They operate
with a collection of mechanical parts such as rods, cables,
pulleys, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces of the
flight deck controls to the control surfaces. Mechanical flight
control systems are still used today in small general and
sport category aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not
excessive.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">This chapter covers the primary systems found on most
aircraft. These include the engine, propeller, induction,
ignition, as well as the fuel, lubrication, cooling, electrical,
landing gear, and environmental control systems.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">In order to safely fly any aircraft, a pilot must understand
how to interpret and operate the flight instruments. The
pilot also needs to be able to recognize associated errors and
malfunctions of these instruments. This chapter addresses the
pitot-static system and associated instruments, the vacuum
system and related instruments, gyroscopic instruments, and
the magnetic compass. When a pilot understands how each
instrument works and recognizes when an instrument is
malfunctioning, he or she can safely utilize the instruments
to their fullest potential.</p>

                                <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Flight Manuals and Other Documents</h4>
                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Each aircraft comes with documentation and a set of manuals
with which a pilot must be familiar in order to fly that aircraft.
This chapter covers airplane flight manuals (AFM), the
pilot’s operating handbook (POH), and aircraft documents
pertaining to ownership, airworthiness, maintenance, and
operations with inoperative equipment. Knowledge of these
required documents and manuals is essential for a pilot to
conduct a safe flight.</p>

is critical to flight safety. Operating above the maximum
weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of
an aircraft and adversely affects its performance. Operation
with the center of gravity (CG) outside the approved limits
results in control difficulty.</p>

                                <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Weather Theory</h4>
                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Weather is an important factor that influences aircraft
performance and flying safety. It is the state of the atmosphere
at a given time and place, with respect to variables such as
temperature (heat or cold), moisture (wetness or dryness),
wind velocity (calm or storm), visibility (clearness or
cloudiness), and barometric pressure (high or low). The term
weather can also apply to adverse or destructive atmospheric
conditions, such as high winds.
This chapter explains basic weather theory and offers pilots
background knowledge of weather principles. It is designed
to help them gain a good understanding of how weather
affects daily flying activities. Understanding the theories
behind weather helps a pilot make sound weather decisions
based on the reports and forecasts obtained from a Flight
Service Station (FSS) weather specialist and other aviation
weather services.
Be it a local flight or a long cross-country flight, decisions
based on weather can dramatically affect the safety of the
flight.</p>

                                <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Aviation Weather Services</h4>
                                <p class="list-group-item-text">In aviation, weather service is a combined effort of the
National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DOD), other
aviation groups, and individuals. Because of the increasing
need for worldwide weather services, foreign weather
organizations also provide vital input.
While weather forecasts are not 100 percent accurate,
meteorologists, through careful scientific study and computer
modeling, have the ability to predict weather patterns, trends,
and characteristics with increasing accuracy. Through a
complex system of weather services, government agencies,
and independent weather observers, pilots and other aviation
professionals receive the benefit of this vast knowledge base
in the form of up-to-date weather reports and forecasts.
These reports and forecasts enable pilots to make informed
decisions regarding weather and flight safety before and
during a flight.</p>

                                <p class="list-group-item-text">Each time a pilot operates an aircraft, the flight normally
begins and ends at an airport. An airport may be a small sod
field or a large complex utilized by air carriers. This chapter
examines airport operations, identifies features of an airport
complex, and provides information on operating on or in the
vicinity of an airport.</p>

nonregulatory. Within these two categories there are four
types: controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other
airspace. Figure 14-1 presents a profile view of the dimensions
of various classes of airspace. Also, there are excerpts from
sectional charts which are discussed in Chapter 15, Navigation,
that are used to illustrate how airspace is depicted.</p>

Air navigation is the process of piloting an aircraft from

position as the flight progresses. It introduces the need for
planning, which includes plotting the course on an aeronautical
chart, selecting checkpoints, measuring distances, obtaining
pertinent weather information, and computing flight time,
headings, and fuel requirements. The methods used in this
chapter include pilotage—navigating by reference to visible
landmarks, dead reckoning—computations of direction and
distance from a known position, and radio navigation—by
use of radio aids.This chapter provides an introduction to cross-country
