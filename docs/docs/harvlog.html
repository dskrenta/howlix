<h2>The Apple ][</h2>

<p>

The apple ][ was the second apple computer ever, it ran on flopys. 
I found an old apple ][ in my basement so i took it out with all the flopys if had and i found all sorts of cool
games that people used and i even found an homemade game that had its own flopy.

<h3>Why Flopys Were The Best Idea Ever</h3>

<p>


Personaly i think that flopy disks were the best idea ever because it was like the first computer disk that you could have games 
on or you could have your own program, on the apple ][ it is faily eassy to run the flopys because all you have to do is put the
disk in then close the flap and type in the right comand into the apple ][ and then wait a couple seconds.
